# Campground Characteristic Analysis of Campgrounds in CA, OR, and WA
## Final Portfolio Project

### Collaborators: 
Priya Arunachalam, Nataliia Sokolova, Vincent Durcan, Shadia Duery, and Anna Rischitelli

### Business Question:
We are a team of consultants hired to determine where to distribute financial resources among the campgrounds in Washington, Oregon, and California. Our goal is to identify which, if any, campground characteristics impact a campground's popularity, so we can make decisions about future funding of our most popular campgrounds.

In short,
- What characteristics describe the most popular campgrounds in Washington, Oregon, and California?

### Project Description:
Describe your project topic, tools you used. 

In order to identify which campgrounds are popular, we needed to define "popularity". We chose 4 dimensions to represent "popularity", which drove our cluster analysis.

*Popularity is defined by: 
- Demand (# of reservations/# of campsites) 
- How far in advance reservations are booked (median time from reservation date to start date) - create normal distribution 
- How far in advance reservations are booked (minimum time from reservation date to start date) - identify outliers 
- Average number nights in reservations

### Findings
- Two features: remoteness and size of campgrounds
