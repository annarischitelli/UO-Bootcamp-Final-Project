### Project Description:

Describe your project topic, tools you used. 

### Project Requirements:

1) Define a business question.

2) Leverage Machine Learning as at least one component of your analysis.

3) You must use: Scikit-Learn and/or other machine learning library.

4) You must use at least two of the below:
Python Pandas, Python Matplotlib, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript Plotly/D3/Leaflet , SQL Database, MongDB Database, Spark, Amazon AWS, Tableau

5) Optional: Host your applicaiton on Heroky, Github or tool of your choice

6) Prepare a 10-minute data storytelling preparation that addresses your business question; mention how ML added to or did not add to your analysis

7) Example projects:
- Create a front-end interface that leverages a ML API to "smarten" the algorithm.
- Perform a deep dive of existing data using various ML methods
- Create a visualization that continues to learn where clusters lie based ML (Use D3 or Plotly to change visualization)
- Create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression.
- Implement your own version of neural network to solve the MNIST problem or a random forest classifier to solve a home valuation problem (must be approved).
