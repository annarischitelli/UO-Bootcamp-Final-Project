# Final Portfolio Project

Website: https://shadiaduery.github.io/Portfolio_Project/

## Title
Resource Assessment of Recreation.gov Campgrounds in the United States

### Collaborators: 
Priya Arunachalam, Nataliia Sokolova, Vincent Durcan, Shadia Duery, and Anna Rischitelli

### Business Question:
We are a team of consultants hired to determine where to distribute financial resources among the campgrounds in Washington, Oregon, and California. Our goal is to identify which, if any, campground characteristics impact a campground's popularity, so we can make decisions about future funding of our most popular campgrounds.

MVP
- What characteristics describe the most popular campgrounds?

Secondary Analysis (if time allows)
- Worst performing sites for comparison

### Hypothesis


### Goals:
1. Discuss the types of activities (ex: winter activities, water activities, climbing-related activities, etc.). Some of these activities are similar and can be grouped. This is important because if a campground has a similar acitivity as another, then you can compare. 

Data cleaning and making sure activity names match so that we can have confidence that our activity comparisons are correct. Without this, you are losing a dimension that can dirty our cluster analysis later (extra column later that is unnecessary). 

Data cleaning = creating confidence in our data to make sure we are correctly answering our question with our further analysis, like choosing the correct variables for ML later.


2. Discuss the most popular activities

3. 

4.  Clustering to understand the relationship between popularity* and activities (Nataliia). 

5. Visually connect Nataliia's findings to our final report

*Popularity is defined by:
    a. Demand (# of reservations/# of campsites)
    b. How far in advance reservations are grouped
    c. Average number nights in reservations
    d. Types of activites

### Project Description:

Describe your project topic, tools you used. 

### Project Requirements:

1) Define a business question.

2) Leverage Machine Learning as at least one component of your analysis.

3) You must use: Scikit-Learn and/or other machine learning library.

4) You must use at least two of the below:
Python Pandas, Python Matplotlib, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript Plotly/D3/Leaflet , SQL Database, MongDB Database, Spark, Amazon AWS, Tableau

5) Optional: Host your application on Heroky, Github or tool of your choice

6) Prepare a 10-minute data storytelling preparation that addresses your business question; mention how ML added to or did not add to your analysis

7) Example projects:
- Create a front-end interface that leverages a ML API to "smarten" the algorithm.
- Perform a deep dive of existing data using various ML methods
- Create a visualization that continues to learn where clusters lie based ML (Use D3 or Plotly to change visualization)
- Create an analysis of existing data to make a prediction, classification, or regression.
- Implement your own version of neural network to solve the MNIST problem or a random forest classifier to solve a home valuation problem (must be approved).
